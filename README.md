# SHA3-256 Algorithm implementation

Calculate **SHA3-256** for every file from archive (https://www.dropbox.com/s/oy2668zp1lsuseh/task2.zip?dl=1)  

**Files here are binary.**

## Step by step procedure:

```bash

 Write hashes as 64 hex digits in lower case.

 Sort (ascending) hashes as strings (not chars in hashes, but hashes as whole).

 Join sorted hashes without any separator.

 Concatenate resulted string with your e-mail in lowercase.

 Find the SHA3-256 of the result string.

```
**Note: SHA3-256 is not the same algorithm as SHA-256.**
